      <description>bye by me, or is it bye bye me? # The lyrics start with the word Monday, indicating the start of the speaker&amp;rsquo;s day (or in this case, the singer). Followed by question: where are you going? For Tuesday, do you have work today? Until Friday, questions are asked. which gives me the following themes:
An elderly gentleman, who suffers from Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s. A father, suffering from the same as above speaking to her daughter.</description>

      <description>It sucks. # You won&amp;rsquo;t know and will not have the chance to know what they think of you. You think you might be doing someone a favor, but another person would think otherwise, which makes you feel ashamed. They assume you have other motives than what you portray, and what they come up with is miles apart! What&amp;rsquo;s worse is when there are a lot of them!
The chance to prove them otherwise may not even come, so what else can I do?</description>
