      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a pain. # Disclaimer:
I’m writing this while under the influence of alcohol. I’m tired and wanted to get the most of my Friday night.
Last night, I was doing some work on a raffle-draw system with thousands of participants. It had around ~5k + people. With less than 24 hours left to finish the job and being confident with the work I’ve done (around 70% of the code), I went to sleep, which was a mistake.</description>

      <description>It sucks. # You won&amp;rsquo;t know and will not have the chance to know what they think of you. You think you might be doing someone a favor, but another person would think otherwise, which makes you feel ashamed. They assume you have other motives than what you portray, and what they come up with is miles apart! What&amp;rsquo;s worse is when there are a lot of them!
The chance to prove them otherwise may not even come, so what else can I do?</description>
