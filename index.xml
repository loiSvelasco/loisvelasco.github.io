      <description>It sucks. Link to heading You won&amp;rsquo;t know and will not have the chance to know what they think of you. You think you might be doing someone a favor, but another person would think otherwise, which makes you feel ashamed. They assume you have other motives than what you portray, and what they come up with is miles apart! What&amp;rsquo;s worse is when there are a lot of them!</description>

      <description>hello world! Link to heading Blogging functionality of this site is set and done thanks to hugo. All that&amp;rsquo;s left to do is some customizations and to clean up my portfolio layout and display them on a dedicated page.
I might finish up customizing this theme first though before doing anything. Got a lot to customize.
Here&amp;rsquo;s to the long road ahead of being a software engineer! üçª</description>
