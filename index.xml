      <description>Is it needed?&gt; Is it needed? # A colleague of mine approached me with an idea of a system that tracks all trainings and seminars an employee or staff attended; in this case, teachers. Since I work in the education sector of our government, they handle a lot of personal records; which then gave me the idea of a portal for teachers (and non-teaching staff too, maybe) much like a portal for students where they can see their grades, schedules, balances, etc.</description>

      <description>bye by me, or is it bye bye me?&gt; bye by me, or is it bye bye me? # The lyrics start with the word Monday, indicating the start of the speaker&amp;rsquo;s day (or in this case, the singer). Followed by question: where are you going? For Tuesday, do you have work today? Until Friday, questions are asked. which gives me the following themes:
An elderly gentleman, who suffers from Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>hello world!&gt; hello world! # Blogging functionality of this site is set and done thanks to hugo. All that&amp;rsquo;s left to do is some customizations and to clean up my portfolio layout and display them on a dedicated page.
I might finish up customizing this theme first though before doing anything. Got a lot to customize.
Here&amp;rsquo;s to the long road ahead of being a software engineer! üçª</description>
