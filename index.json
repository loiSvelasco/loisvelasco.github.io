[{"content":"Is it needed? # A colleague of mine approached me with an idea of a system that tracks all trainings and seminars an employee or staff attended; in this case, teachers. Since I work in the education sector of our government, they handle a lot of personal records; which then gave me the idea of a portal for teachers (and non-teaching staff too, maybe) much like a portal for students where they can see their grades, schedules, balances, etc. It will work the same but for different sets of data, i.e. trainings attended, to attend, past trainings offered, personal work records, work history, accomplishments, innovations, etc.\nWhen thinking about it, these specific sets of records can and will help the selection process for teachers for promotion, even if this system is only accessible by our division, they will be able to extract the info they need and present it where they need it presented. Think of this as a digital copy of self and work related documents. To answer the question, yes; it is needed.\nWhat will be my approach? # A web-based approach fits this project perfectly. It enables access across devices, regardless of where you are, and this might even serve the whole region if built and maintained correctly. Which I hope I could, I work alone without a team so I\u0026rsquo;ll do my best.\nRequirements? # For end-users, all that is needed is a computer or mobile phone, and a stable internet connection.

Followed by question: where are you going? For Tuesday, do you have work today? Until Friday, questions are asked. which gives me the following themes:\nAn elderly gentleman, who suffers from Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s. A father, suffering from the same as above speaking to her daughter. A man who suffers from amnesia. A lost individual. The first two themes make perfect sense; an elderly man speaking dearly to his significant other; a father speaking to his daughter, asking how her day was; what is happening; how is she doing; what is new; what stories can she tell; anything, just to have a conversation or to be in the loop with his loved ones. It is plausible, until you ponder the title.\nBye by me # The last 2 themes may seem dark, sad, or dramatic. But our opinions may vary. Let us (or me) talk about the third theme, which is a man who suffers from amnesia.\nIn the latter minutes of the song, there is a part which roughly translates to\n\u0026ldquo;Welcome home, but it\u0026rsquo;s alright, I have nothing special to talk about.\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Welcome home, but it\u0026rsquo;s okay, I can\u0026rsquo;t remember anyway.\u0026rdquo;\nand in an even later part, \u0026ldquo;I remember how I loved you so much, I\u0026rsquo;ll love you, if we ever meet again. You must not forget, I already told you what I wanted to say.\u0026rdquo;\nBye by me, or bye from me, since I might forget you.\nFor the fourth theme, a lost individual, here comes the bye bye me, explanation for this seems unnecessary (well, this whole blog post is unnecessary, I just wanted to publish my thoughts.) but anyway, returning to the topic, is a man who wants to leave this world, after expressing what he needs to express and telling what needs to be told, a man who is getting ready to leave this world.\nI lean more on my third interpretation, but that\u0026rsquo;s just my opinion. It may be miles apart from what the artists\u0026rsquo; true intentions are, but that\u0026rsquo;s the beauty of it.\n","date":"October 8, 2022","permalink":"/2022/10/an-unnecessary-analysis-of-the-song-bye-by-me-/-vaundy/","section":"Rants","summary":"bye by me, or is it bye bye me? # The lyrics start with the word Monday, indicating the start of the speaker\u0026rsquo;s day (or in this case, the singer).

Printing of CSC Form 48 is improved and can now print two copies with a single sheet of A4 paper.

The eDTS achieves better organization of documents by visualizing your current physical arrayed documents in a user-friendly, digital approach.\nThis project also aims to optimize the tracking process, enabling bulk releasing and receiving for units with a lot of documents to work on for improved efficiency.\nAn added feature of the eDTS is the ability for users to scan the documents to automatically receive it without having to type the tracking no. (Typing is still supported)\n1. Account # This section shows the basic overview of an account and how it is used in the system.\nCreating an account # Fields needed to create an account is a valid e-mail address, full name, school or unit the account needs to belong in, and a password.\ne-mail address is needed for the system to send you an e-mail when requesting for a password reset. The full name is required to provide additional data on who received or released the document, this eliminates ambiguity in the system and provides much more needed information regarding how the documents are processed. School or unit is a group of users where an account belongs in, multiple users can be in a school or unit, and anyone can receive, release, or create a document within the unit. Signing in # This does not need any additional explanation. Although keep in mind that when signed in and you have been inactive for 25 minutes, you will automatically be logged out for security purposes.\nRequesting for a new password # You can change your password in the profile section, above the logout link when clicking on the user icon.\nIf you forgot your password, enter your e-mail address on the field and you will receive an auto generated e-mail on how to reset your password, please check if you typed your e-mail correctly and check your spam or trash folders on your e-mail service provider. You will receive an e-mail instantly, if not - try again within a few minutes.\n2. Adding documents # Adding documents can only be done when a user is logged in. It is found on the left sidebar menu on the user\u0026rsquo;s dashboard.\nFields needed to add a document are as follows: Document title Description Document type Release to Purpose / Remarks Office origin, and the date of document creation are automatically generated.\nTracking number # Tracking no. is used to track documents and it shows which office currently holds said document. Here is what a typical tracking number looks like:\n4522-101698\nNotice that there are two parts on the tracking number. The first part which is separated by a dash (-), shows the date of when the document is created in the format MMDDYY. In this case, the document is created during the 5th of April in the year 2022 (4522), leading zeroes are omitted to keep the tracking number clean and compact. The second part is just a random 6 digit identifier. Tables displayed in the system are searchable, users are able to search for a tracking number with only the six digit identifier, the date is just there to provide instant information on when it was created.\nUpon document creation, an alert message will show on whatever page you are on below the page title. You can then write the tracking number on the physical document, or you can click on it, which leads us to the next item, printing of the tracking number.\nPrinting of sdoin-dts tracking number # Printing of the document tracking number opens up a new tab, and a print preview. The placement of the tracking number and the barcode are at the top right corner of the page.\nIdeal process on printing the barcode:\nCreate the document with an office application. Create a new document / tracking number using the system. Copy the generated barcode and paste it on the document; or Print the tracking number on the first page of said document by reinserting the page on the printer. Uploading of Documents # This section is intended for accounts under the units OSDS OFFICE, SGOD Chief, CID Chief.\nThe only allowed documents for upload are those for dissemination only.\nFiletype supported: PDF, maximum file size is 10MB.\n3. Receiving and Releasing # Receiving and releasing is the main focus of this project. It provides data on how documents are being processed and also provides a map of when and where documents are received.\nReceiving and releasing documents # The table view for receiving and releasing documents is found on the left sidebar menu on the user\u0026rsquo;s dashboard. The table consists of three columns:\nCheckbox This allows the user to select multiple document to receive or release at once. Document title Action The receiving table only has a receive action, while the release table has two actions: Release Mark as accomplished Note: Mark as accomplished is only available for documents that are already received. Marking multiple documents as accomplished is not supported as this action is irreversible. Scanning a barcode to receive document # Scanning to receive is supported, in this page, a textbox is provided to read the code from the scanner. When scanning, make sure the caret is on the textbox for proper functionality. Along with this, a quick release table is provided, which allows the user to quickly release the document if needed.\nMarking documents as accomplished # This function is mainly used for the purpose of making the release table clean, by removing completed documents from the table and putting them in a different table.\n4. Report generation # This is the main output of the system.\nPer-day generation # On the reports page, four cards are displayed below the title bar Received, Released, To Receive, and Accomplished Documents The numbers displayed are of the current date.\nDate-range generation # Clicking on more info found under the cards redirects the user on a page with a date-range selector, when selected and submitted, it returns all actions within the selected date.\nKeeping track of all created documents # This table shows all created documents regardless if accomplished or not.\nLicense # This project is licensed under the MIT License ","date":"January 1, 1","permalink":"/portfolio/dts/","section":"Portfolio","summary":"You can view the entire code on my GitHub This manual is still being written and it is still unfinished.\nEnhanced Document Tracking System for SDOIN # This project aims to improve the current tracking system used in the Schools Division of Ilocos Norte.
