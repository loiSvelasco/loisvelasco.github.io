[{"content":"bye by me, or is it bye bye me? # The lyrics start with the word Monday, indicating the start of the speaker\u0026rsquo;s day (or in this case, the singer). Followed by question: where are you going? For Tuesday, do you have work today? Until Friday, questions are asked. which gives me the following themes:\nAn elderly gentleman, who suffers from Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s. A father, suffering from the same as above speaking to her daughter. A man who suffers from amnesia. A lost individual. The first two themes make perfect sense; an elderly man speaking dearly to his significant other; a father speaking to his daughter, asking how her day was; what is happening; how is she doing; what is new; what stories can she tell; anything, just to have a conversation or to be in the loop with his loved ones. It is plausible, until you ponder the title.\nBye by me # The last 2 themes may seem dark, sad, or dramatic. But our opinions may vary. Let us (or me) talk about the third theme, which is a man who suffers from amnesia.\nIn the latter minutes of the song, there is a part which roughly translates to\n\u0026ldquo;Welcome home, but it\u0026rsquo;s alright, I have nothing special to talk about.\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Welcome home, but it\u0026rsquo;s okay, I can\u0026rsquo;t remember anyway.\u0026rdquo;\nand in an even later part, \u0026ldquo;I remember how I loved you so much, I\u0026rsquo;ll love you, if we ever meet again. You must not forget, I already told you what I wanted to say.\u0026rdquo;\nBye by me, or bye from me, since I might forget you.\nFor the fourth theme, a lost individual, here comes the bye bye me, explanation for this seems unnecessary (well, this whole blog post is unnecessary, I just wanted to publish my thoughts.) but anyway, returning to the topic, is a man who wants to leave this world, after expressing what he needs to express and telling what needs to be told, a man who is getting ready to leave this world.\nI lean more on my third interpretation, but that\u0026rsquo;s just my opinion. It may be miles apart from what the artists\u0026rsquo; true intentions are, but that\u0026rsquo;s the beauty of it.\n","date":"October 8, 2022","permalink":"/2022/10/an-unnecessary-analysis-of-the-song-bye-by-me-/-vaundy/","section":"Posts","summary":"bye by me, or is it bye bye me? # The lyrics start with the word Monday, indicating the start of the speaker\u0026rsquo;s day (or in this case, the singer).

I‚Äôm tired and wanted to get the most of my Friday night.\nLast night, I was doing some work on a raffle-draw system with thousands of participants. It had around ~5k + people. With less than 24 hours left to finish the job and being confident with the work I‚Äôve done (around 70% of the code), I went to sleep, which was a mistake.\nHere was my ideal scenario:\nflowchart LR 1(Go to bed) --\u003e 2(Close my eyes) --\u003e 3(Magically fall asleep) But what happened was,\nflowchart LR 1(Go to bed) --\u003e 2(Close my eyes) --\u003e 3(Discover an error) 3 --\u003e 4(Think of a solution) --\u003e 5{Problem solved?} 5 --no--\u003e 4 5 --yes--\u003e 3 Yes, I slept with an endless loop on my mind last night. Fortunately, I was able to resolve all the issues with plenty of time for testing. I really was tempted to just get out of bed and work on it just to have decent sleep. and I was really amazed at how much thinking about coding hinders sleep.\nThe event went smoothly, and there were hiccups with the system, but mostly because of the lack of internet connection. AJAX requests took too long to respond, which made the system look slow, but when operating under normal conditions with a decent connection, it works flawlessly.\nThe infinite errors I found while pondering it on my bed the other night were really simple to solve when I woke up. Maybe this is a lesson too, that you don‚Äôt think of solutions when tired. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure, but I discovered I work well with code when I‚Äôm focused and sharp. That goes for all of us who work in software engineering though, but meh, at least now I know it works for me.\n","date":"October 6, 2022","permalink":"/2022/10/go-to-sleep-with-no-lingering-thoughts/","section":"Posts","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s a pain. # Disclaimer:\nI‚Äôm writing this while under the influence of alcohol.
