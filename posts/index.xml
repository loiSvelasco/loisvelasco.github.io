      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m publishing this just to have easy access to this statement, which I 100% agree with. a MORAL ACT is one that decreases individual human suffering and/or betters societal well-being, justice, freedom, and equality.

      <description>Is it needed?&gt; Is it needed? # A colleague of mine approached me with an idea of a system that tracks all trainings and seminars an employee or staff attended; in this case, teachers. Since I work in the education sector of our government, they handle a lot of personal records; which then gave me the idea of a portal for teachers (and non-teaching staff too, maybe) much like a portal for students where they can see their grades, schedules, balances, etc.</description>

      <description>hello world!&gt; hello world! # Blogging functionality of this site is set and done thanks to hugo. All that&amp;rsquo;s left to do is some customizations and to clean up my portfolio layout and display them on a dedicated page.
I might finish up customizing this theme first though before doing anything. Got a lot to customize.
Here&amp;rsquo;s to the long road ahead of being a software engineer! üçª</description>
