      <description>Is it needed?&gt; Is it needed? # A colleague of mine approached me with an idea of a system that tracks all trainings and seminars an employee or staff attended; in this case, teachers.

      <description>hello world!&gt; hello world! # Blogging functionality of this site is set and done thanks to hugo. All that&amp;rsquo;s left to do is some customizations and to clean up my portfolio layout and display them on a dedicated page.
I might finish up customizing this theme first though before doing anything. Got a lot to customize.
Here&amp;rsquo;s to the long road ahead of being a software engineer! üçª</description>
